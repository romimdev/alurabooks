# ALURABOOKS
Alura Responsiveness Project
Status: Completed âœ…

## GOAL
This project was made with the objective of improving my performance with HTML and CSS and further developing the work with the Media Queries that are so important for the responsive design of the site.

## FUNCTIONALITIES
### FUNCTIONAL HEADING
A header was made to work according to the size of the device being used. For cell phones, a hamburger menu was developed to facilitate access to new pages on the site. In addition, the visitor will be able to visualize his favorite items, his bag and also his profile using the icons of that same header.
On the tablet and also on the desktop version, clicking on Categories will open a menu to access new pages. In addition, you will have access to your bookshelf.
